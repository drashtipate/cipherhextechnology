                <p>Many people don't think about their family values until a crisis arises that forces them 
                    to make decisions that may go against their beliefs. While they may have never identified 
                    their values, all of sudden they are faced with the realization that something doesn't 
                    quite fit into what they believe in. This is when people realize how important family values
                    are to the structure and operation of their family system.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="mt-5">2. How Important Values Are to the Family System - Ranpariya Parivar</h2>
                <p>
                    Family values are important on many different levels of the family structure.
                </p>
                </br>
                <p>1. Establishing a Foundation for the Family</br>
                    A foundation supports a family. When crises arise, the family is able to withstand them because of 
                    the stability of the relational structure. Families with defined values are able to 
                    stand strong on their views despite other people's efforts to break through with 
                    opposing beliefs. In addition, when family members feel weak from the cold outside world,
                    they know they can come into their family for a warm comforting connection.
                </p></br>
                <p>2. Influencing Decision Making</br>
                    Family values influence the decisions people make both within the family structure and outside of it. Making a decision about important topics can be difficult, and people may feel helpless if they don't know which way to proceed. Therefore, having solid family values helps people make the right decisions in life.
                </p></br>
                <p>3. Guidance for Raising Children</br>
                    Parenting can be a challenge and with all of the world's influences, it can be downright scary. Knowing what you believe in as a parent and what you want for your children will help you raise them to be responsible and conscientious adults.
                </p></br>
                <p>4. Protection from Outside Influences</br>
                    Peer pressure can have a considerable effect on adolescents and adults alike. When people try to get others to do things that are not morally correct, they try to penetrate the family values set in place. That means, if someone has a strong sense of what is right and wrong because of the values they were raised with, they are less likely to become victims of deviant influences.
                </p></br>
                <p>5. Giving Family Meaning</br>
                    What does family mean to you? When people think about the definition of family, they usually say something about feeling connected because they share the same views of the world. While some family members may differ on views of some topics, most family members keep the largest, most influential, beliefs intact.
                </p></br>
                <p>6. Helping Guide People in Relationships</br>
                    People usually relate to others who share the same values as them because they are more compatible with one another. However, to find compatibility you need to know what you believe in so you know what to look for when looking for a mate or friend. Families with strong values are able to identify these values in others quickly, which then produces a new generation with similar beliefs.
